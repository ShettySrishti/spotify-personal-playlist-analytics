# 🎧 Spotify Playlist Analytics Command Center
![Spotify Command Center](analytics-visuals/dashboard-spotify-command-center.gif)

An end-to-end ETL pipeline that transforms raw Spotify API data into an interactive Power BI dashboard. It uses Azure Databricks (Python/PySpark/SQL) to clean and structure data into a professional Star Schema, featuring custom metrics and AI-driven insights to analyze listening habits

## Tech Stack
- **Cloud**: Azure Databricks
- **Processing**: Python, PySpark, SparkSQL
- **API**: Spotify Web API (via Spotipy library)
- **Storage**: Delta Lake (Bronze/Silver/Gold). All 6 tables are stored as ACID compliant Delta tables in the default Databricks SQL database, ensuring data integrity and high-speed retrieval for Power BI.
- **BI & Modeling**: Power BI Desktop (Star Schema / DAX)

## System Architecture & Pipeline
This project follows a modern data stack pipeline, moving from raw ingestion to a structured Semantic Layer.

## 🔄 The Medallion Data Pipeline
1. _**Bronze (Raw)**_: Extracted raw JSON responses from the Spotify API for `Playlist#1` into initial staging tables.
2. _**Silver (Filtered)**_: Cleaned, deduplicated, and normalized track data using PySpark and SparkSQL to handle nested structures.
3. _**Gold (Curated Star Schema)**_: Engineered 6 final Delta Tables optimized for ACID compliance and performance.
4. _**Semantic Modeling**_: Integrated the Gold Layer into Power BI and engineered a Star Schema, managing all tracks with complex active/inactive relationships.

## Technical Highlights
- **Data Engineering**: Engineered a robust ETL pipeline in Azure Databricks using Python and Spark to automate data cleaning.
- **API Integration**: Python ETL notebooks in Databricks use the Spotipy client to authenticate and pull playlist and track metadata from the Spotify Web API.
- **Behavioral DAX**: Authored a custom "Loyalty Score" metric using advanced logic to quantify user dedication to specific artists.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Implemented an interactive Decomposition Tree for root-cause analysis from Artist popularity down to individual Track Duration.
- **UI/UX Design**: Built a sleek, "Floating Neon" Dark-Mode interface optimized for high-density reporting without visual noise.
- **Search Integration**: Enabled a search bar within the Artist Slicer for instant navigation through all the tracks in the `Playlist#1`.

## Data Model (ERD)
Star Schema with 6 Gold Layer tables:
- Central Fact: `_fact_track_breakdown_`
- Dimensions: `_dim_artist_stats_`, `_dim_album_stats_`, `_dim_date_dimension_`,  `_dim_timeline_trends_`, `_dim_top_tier_tracks_`
- Dynamic cross-filtering: AI Tree selection updates "Total Tracks" KPI (147 → 1)
